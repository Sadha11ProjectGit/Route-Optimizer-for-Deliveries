# Route Optimizer Project

## Overview

This project implements a **Route Optimizer** for delivery systems using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path calculation. The system optimizes delivery routes based on various factors like **distance**, **time**, and **real-time traffic conditions**. It also supports optimization based on **delivery time windows**.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation** using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
- **Real-time Traffic Updates** (traffic factors adjust distances)
- **Multiple Optimization Criteria** (time, cost, etc.)
- **Delivery Window Constraints** for optimizing delivery schedules

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later
- MySQL Database
- Maven (for dependencies, if using Maven)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/route-optimizer.git
